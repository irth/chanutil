# chanutil

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/irth/chanutil.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/irth/chanutil)

Some utilities for interacting with channels that I use in my code.

Currently, it's so small, that it probably makes no sense to use it. Feel free
to just steal the code you want, no need to introduce unnecessary dependency
on this lib. It's MIT.
